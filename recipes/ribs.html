<h1>BBQ Ribs</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Originally an American invention, succulent and smoky barbecue ribs have become one of the most famous dishes in the world. The dish is typically prepared with pork ribs, usually spareribs or the tender, leaner baby back ribs. Pork is the obvious choice for the dish since it tends to be juicier on the bone, allowing the meat to come right off after the grilling process. It is one of the barbecued dishes which leans on the American-style grilling, in which the meat is cooked long, slow, and at a low temperature. To give the ribs their distinct taste and texture, they are always treated before grilling. Two most common ways include marinating and dry-rubbing.</p>
        <p>Marinating is usually done with soy or Worchester sauce, different spices, ketchup, and occasionally even whisky or honey. As the name suggests, dry-rub is usually made with powdered spices such as smoked paprika, garlic, Mediterranean or Oriental spices, sugar, and mustard. During grilling, the ribs are repeatedly smothered with a spicy barbecue sauce, which eventually provides the ribs with a luscious, viscous, and slightly spicy external layer. Ribs are a typical part of classic American barbecues, although they can be found in restaurants around the world and are also commonly prepared at home.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>For the ribs: Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Season the ribs all over with salt. In a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add the ribs and brown on all sides, turning with tongs, 5 minutes a side. Transfer to a platter and pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat.</p>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Add the onion, carrots, garlic, lemon grass and ginger to the pot. Cook over high heat until lightly browned, 3 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar and 3 cups water, and bring to a boil. Return the ribs to the pot, immersing them in the liquid. Tightly cover and bake, turning the ribs once or twice until very tender, about 3 1/2 hours. Let the ribs cool in the liquid, then drain well. (Ribs can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.) </p>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>For the glaze: In a heavy saucepan, combine all the glaze ingredients and simmer over medium heat until thick, about 10 minutes. Strain.</p>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p>Prepare a grill for direct grilling over high heat. Brush and oil the grate. Cook the ribs until dark brown all over, 3 to 5 minutes a side, basting with the glaze. Serve with the remaining glaze drizzled on top or passed separately in a bowl.</p>
